## USDA ERS Retail Produce Prices: 2025 Comprehensive Briefing and Analysis

### Executive Summary

Recent USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) compilations deliver granular, annually updated pricing data for a wide range of fruits and vegetables—across fresh, canned, frozen, dried, and juice forms—integrating extensive market scanner data, refined edible yield conversion, and serving size standardization. This analysis holistically examines the structure, trends, and implications of these national data, highlighting chronic and acute trends, price volatility, differentiation by form and processing, and the resulting impacts on food affordability and nutrition policy.

### 1. Data Structure and ERS Methodology

**A. Data Foundations**

- ERS’s 2025 update crucially uses Circana OmniMarket Core Outlets scanner data, capturing billions of item-level transactions at retail chains and club stores nationally, thereby overcoming sampling and representation issues present in older BLS-based datasets.
- Scanner data provide high-frequency, high-resolution information, supporting more precise price, volume, and trend analysis for numerous product forms, sizes, and brands.

**B. Yield and Edible Portion Adjustment**

- All prices per pound (and per pint/fluid ounce for juices) are transformed to actual consumer cost using conversion factors from USDA Handbooks, which account for losses from skin, rind, seeds, excess moisture, and cooking.
- For instance, a fresh watermelon’s “yield” is only about 52%, reflecting removal of rind; canned/frozen variants exhibit much higher yields due to preprocess removal of waste. Cooked leafy greens often shrink by ~20–30% in weight.

**C. Cup Equivalent and Serving Size Standardization**

- Data translate edible weights into “cup equivalents”—a half-cup serving for most fruits and vegetables, in line with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This enables apples-to-apples (pun intended) cost comparisons between product types, forms, and families.
- For example, “cup equivalent price” allows a direct comparison of the cost to consume a serving of, say, fresh broccoli versus canned green beans.


### 2. Market Trends and Detailed Comparative Analysis

#### A. Price Progression and Inflationary Trends

- **Fruits:** Notable price increases since 2010 across fresh, canned, frozen, and dried forms, fueled by input, labor, logistical, and climate-related pressures.
    - Fresh apples, a price-stable dietary staple, have risen from ~\$1.52/lb (2010) to ~\$1.85/lb (2025); bananas from \$0.52 to \$0.60/lb; berries (particularly raspberries and blackberries) show some of the most accentuated spikes (raspberries ~\$7.73/lb fresh in 2025 vs. ~\$6.64  in 2010).
    - Dried fruits universally command premium prices: dried mangoes over \$10/lb; prune, date, and fig prices remain resilient even amid broader inflation.
- **Vegetables:**
    - Potatoes (~\$0.82/lb fresh), cabbage (green ~\$0.80/lb), and carrots (~\$0.98/lb raw) present the least expensive options on a per-serving basis.
    - Premium or specialty items (artichokes, asparagus, okra) feature considerable price escalation, and form (fresh vs. canned/frozen) can more than double per-serving costs.
    - Processed vegetable forms (canned/frozen) sometimes yield lower cost per serving (e.g., canned tomatoes, beans), but not universally—frozen asparagus, for example, remains well above fresh in per-serving cost.


#### B. Price Differentials by Form and Processing

- *Fresh vs. Canned/Frozen*: Many vegetables (e.g., carrots, green beans, corn) and some fruits (peaches, pears) are regularly less expensive in processed forms, primarily due to industrial-scale yield management, seasonal price smoothing, and process efficiency.
    - However, in some cases (e.g., artichokes, asparagus), canned/frozen forms can be as or more expensive than fresh, especially if products are imported or targeted as gourmet/convenience items.
- *Juices*: Fruit juices universally deliver the lowest per-serving prices (\$0.35–\$0.62/cup equivalent) but can vary in nutritional density due to fiber and vitamin loss during processing.
- *Dried Fruits*: Highest cost per serving (several times more than fresh/canned) due to water removal concentrating weight per serving, plus high processing/handling costs.


#### C. Serving Size Economics

- **“Cup Equivalent Price”**: Standardizing to edible cup equivalent reveals significant practical cost differences for consumers:
    - Potatoes, carrots, cabbage, and bananas are very affordable per serving, typically at or below \$0.30–\$0.35/cup equivalent.
    - Premium berries, certain leafy greens, and specialty vegetables like okra and artichokes can exceed \$1–\$2 per serving, putting them out of reach for lower-income consumers if purchased fresh and out of season.


#### D. Affordability Scenarios and Substitution Insights

- A family of four seeking to meet the Dietary Guidelines recommendation of 5 servings/day/person (70 cup equivalents/week) could, with careful selection from lower-priced fresh or processed items, spend under \$15–\$20/week on fruits and vegetables. However, favoring premium items or out-of-season produce could easily double that cost.
- Substituting fresh with processed (frozen/canned) in several cases delivers substantial savings without dramatic nutrition loss, especially where salt or sugar content in processing is minimal.
- These data confirm the ERS’s earlier findings: replacing common calorie-dense snacks with fruit or vegetable servings does not necessarily increase food costs—and, depending on choices, may reduce household spending (especially swapping high-cost snacks for low-cost produce) while also lowering calorie intake, supporting public health strategies.


### 3. Limitations and Critical Observations

- **Annual Average Data**: These figures are annual national averages; local and seasonal variation (e.g., summer berry glut, winter greens scarcity) is not captured. In practice, farmers’ markets, CSAs, and discount outlets may offer opportunities unrepresented in scanner datasets.
- **Non-Nutritional Differentiation**: The database does not account for quality, added sugars/salt, or taste—important metrics when substituting canned/frozen/dried for fresh.
- **Food Security Relevance**: While low-cost healthy options exist, persistent price premiums for certain fruits and vegetables may inadvertently shape diets and contribute to disparities in nutrition outcomes.
- **Policy Sensitivity**: SNAP and WIC purchasing power should be regularly benchmarked to this data to ensure food assistance keeps up with inflation and actual consumer prices.


### 4. Policy and Consumer Guidance Implications

**For Policymakers:**

- These data justify the need for:
    - **Indexing SNAP/WIC benefits** to real produce price trends.
    - **Nutrition education** around lower-cost, healthy fruit and vegetable choices, especially in forms (frozen/canned) that offer equivalent or better value during price spikes.
    - **Monitoring inflationary/seasonal spikes** in key commodity produce items, and exploring temporary supplemental benefits or targeted subsidies (e.g., for berries, leafy greens).

**For Consumers:**

- Price-conscious shoppers can maximize both nutrition and affordability by favoring:
    - Bananas, apples, oranges, potatoes, carrots, and cabbage for fresh consumption.
    - Seasonal purchases and bulk buying.
    - Using more canned/frozen forms—especially for soups, stews, or smoothies where texture differences are minimized.

**Health and Industry:**

- Consistent evidence that some nutrient-dense produce remains affordable bolsters obesity/diabetes prevention campaigns focused on behavioral change, rather than solely subsidy expansion.
- Food manufacturers and grocers can use this data to guide in-store promotions, “mix-and-match” produce deals, and “budget basket” guidance.


### 5. Outlook and Recommendations

- Continued annual updates and expanded “market basket” tracking, including organics and additional distinguishing features, will further empower food system stakeholders.
- Enhanced integration of regional, temporal, and quality dimensions will improve service to consumers, foodservice, and public health agencies.
- Long-term, greater transparency will help close equity gaps, ensuring that all Americans can afford diets rich in fruits and vegetables.

**In summary:** The latest USDA ERS produce price data—incorporating advanced retail scanner analytics, refined serving cost calculations, and robust edible yield processing—offers unparalleled detail to policymakers, researchers, and consumers. While confirmed inflation and shifting price hierarchies create challenges, the data robustly supports the argument that, with strategic selection, healthy eating remains attainable and affordable for most households. Ongoing adaptation to market and policy shifts will keep these insights maximally relevant for years to come.
