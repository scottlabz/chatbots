# Cost-Efficient and Nutritional Value of Fruit & Vegetable Snack Substitutions for Children

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares retail pricing data across **fruit and vegetable commodities from 2020 and 2022**, integrating insights from a **USDA ERS snack substitution study**. The goal is to identify cost-effective substitutions that offer calorie savings and align with behavioral trends in children aged 6–13. Results indicate that dried legumes and select fresh fruits—particularly bananas, watermelon, and dried beans—provide the greatest savings per edible portion while significantly reducing caloric intake compared to traditional snack foods.

## 2. Price Shifts from 2020 to 2022

### Fruits

- Minimal inflation observed:
  - *Bananas* rose modestly from ~$0.28 to $0.31 per cup

## 3. Snack Substitution Outcomes

The USDA ERS study modeled **400 snack-for-produce substitutions**:

- **Average calorie savings**: 126 calories per substitution
- **Top substitutions**:
  - Danish pastry → apple = *194 calories saved*
  - Cookie → banana = *46 calories saved*
- **Average cost shift**: Net household savings of $7.00/year with substitutions

| Substitution Example        | Price/Cup | Calories Saved | Type       |
|----------------------------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Cookie → Banana            | $0.31     | 46             | Fruit      |
| Pastry → Watermelon        | $0.24     | 160–194        | Fruit      |
| Chips → Carrots (raw)      | $0.30     | ~130           | Vegetable  |
| Crackers → Pinto Beans     | $0.22     | ~150           | Legume     |

## 4. Nutritional and Behavioral Recommendations

**Optimal Substitution Criteria**:
- <$0.35 per cup
- >100 calories saved
- High yield and prep ease

**Recommended Produce Champions**:
- Watermelon
- Banana
- Raw Carrots
- Green Cabbage
- Dried Pinto Beans

These options are not only budget-friendly but also frequently preferred by children, especially when presented creatively (e.g., fruit kabobs, bean dips, veggie wraps).

## 5. Creative Application for Educational Outreach

For storytelling projects such as your book featuring *Sydney the boxer dog*, these insights lend themselves to:
- Building playful narratives around healthy choices ("Sydney trades biscuits for berry bites!")
- Visualizing cost-savings and nutrition gains in child-friendly formats
- Promoting parental guidance on affordable shopping

## 6. Policy and Public Health Implications

- **Economic Accessibility**: Beans and bulk fruits mitigate food deserts where packaged snacks dominate
- **School Meal Planning**: Fresh produce integration can be done without major budget increases
- **Behavioral Nudges**: Structured substitution (one snack/day) leads to scalable caloric reduction
