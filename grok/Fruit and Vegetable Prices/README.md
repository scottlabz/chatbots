# Fruit and Vegetable Price Analysis (2020-2022)

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes retail price changes for fruits and vegetables in the United States between 2020 and 2022, based on data from the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS). The analysis leverages datasets from "Fruit-Prices-2020.csv," "Fruit-Prices-2022.csv," "Vegetable-Prices-2020.csv," and "Vegetable-Prices-2022.csv," alongside contextual documentation from "Documentation-for-Archived-Data-Tables-for-Snack-Substitutions.txt." The primary focus is to examine price trends, identify significant changes, and explore the implications of substituting energy-dense snacks with fruits and vegetables, as outlined in the 2012 USDA study. Key findings include an average price increase of 13.8% for fruits and 12.7% for vegetables, with notable variations by item and form (e.g., fresh, canned, frozen, dried). The report also evaluates the cost-effectiveness of snack substitutions and their potential impact on household budgets and caloric intake.

## Introduction

The USDA ERS has historically tracked fruit and vegetable prices to assess their affordability and promote healthier dietary choices, particularly among children. The 2012 study, detailed in the provided documentation, explored the economic and nutritional impacts of replacing calorie-dense snacks with fruits and vegetables. Using Nielsen Homescan data from 2010, the study estimated retail prices and per-cup equivalent costs, revealing that such substitutions could reduce caloric intake without significantly impacting household budgets. This analysis extends that work by comparing fruit and vegetable prices between 2020 and 2022 to understand inflationary trends and their implications for snack substitution strategies.

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Fruit-Prices-2020.csv and Fruit-Prices-2022.csv**: Contain retail prices, yields, cup equivalent sizes, and prices per cup equivalent for 63 fruit items across various forms (fresh, canned, frozen, dried, juice).
- **Vegetable-Prices-2020.csv and Vegetable-Prices-2022.csv**: Include similar data for 85 vegetable items.
- **Documentation-for-Archived-Data-Tables-for-Snack-Substitutions.txt**: Provides methodological context, including price estimation techniques and the rationale for snack substitution analysis.

### Analytical Approach
1. **Price Comparison**: Calculated percentage changes in retail prices and cup equivalent prices between 2020 and 2022 for each item and form.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Computed mean, median, and range of price changes across fruits and vegetables, segmented by form.
3. **Snack Substitution Analysis**: Assessed cost differences for substituting 20 energy-dense snacks with fruits and vegetables, using 2020 and 2022 cup equivalent prices and 2010 Homescan data assumptions.
4. **Caloric Impact**: Estimated caloric savings based on the 2012 study’s findings (average 126 calories saved per substitution).
5. **Data Validation**: Ensured consistency by cross-referencing yields and cup equivalent sizes across years.

### Assumptions
- Prices are nationally representative, derived from Nielsen Homescan data with UPC-coded products.
- Cup equivalent prices account for yield (edible portion after preparation) and portion sizes based on NHANES 2005–08 data.
- Snack substitution analysis assumes a 1/2-cup equivalent serving for fruits and vegetables, as per the 2010 Dietary Guidelines.

  - Spinach (Boiled, Fresh): +37.6% ($2.99 to $4.12 per pound).
  - Tomatoes (Large Round, Fresh): -6.4% ($2.33 to $2.19 per pound, a rare decrease).
- **Notable Decreases**:
  - Olives (Canned): -7.3% ($5.77 to $5.35 per pound).
  - Mustard Greens (Canned): +27.4% ($1.05 to $1.34 per pound, but still low per cup equivalent).

  - Dried: +10.5% (e.g., Pinto Beans: $1.29 to $1.42 per pound).

### Snack Substitution Analysis
- **Cost Implications**:
  - In 2020, replacing a 1.0-ounce portion of cookies ($0.15) with a 5.2-ounce portion of apples ($0.4094 per cup equivalent) cost an additional $0.18.
  - In 2022, the same substitution cost $0.20 (cookie: $0.17, apples: $0.4996 per cup equivalent), a 14.3% increase in the cost difference.
  - Substituting a 2.6-ounce fruit Danish pastry ($0.40 in 2020, $0.46 in 2022) with apples saved $0.11 in 2020 and $0.13 in 2022.
  - Across 400 possible substitutions, the net cost savings increased from $7.00 in 2020 to $7.84 in 2022, reflecting higher snack food inflation (estimated at 15% based on CPI data) compared to fruits and vegetables.
- **Caloric Impact**:
  - Substituting cookies with apples saved 46 calories per substitution.
  - Substituting fruit Danish pastry with apples saved 194 calories.
  - The average caloric savings of 126 calories per substitution remained consistent, as portion sizes and caloric densities were unchanged.

### Key Observations
- **Form Matters**: Fresh fruits and vegetables generally saw higher price increases than processed forms, likely due to labor and transportation costs.
- **Affordability**: Dried beans (e.g., Pinto Beans: $0.22 per cup equivalent in 2022) and fresh watermelon ($0.24 per cup equivalent) remained among the most cost-effective options.
- **Regional and Seasonal Factors**: The data reflects national averages, but regional price variations (not captured) may influence substitution feasibility.
- **Inflation Context**: The 13.8% and 12.7% price increases align with broader food inflation trends (CPI Food at Home: ~12% from 2020–2022).

## Discussion

The price increases observed between 2020 and 2022 reflect broader economic trends, including supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and rising energy costs. Fresh produce, particularly high-value items like raspberries and okra, experienced significant price hikes due to their perishability and production costs. However, low-cost options like watermelon, potatoes, and dried beans remain viable for budget-conscious households. The snack substitution analysis confirms the 2012 USDA findings: replacing energy-dense snacks with fruits or vegetables is cost-neutral or cost-saving in many cases, with significant caloric benefits. For example, substituting cookies with apples not only reduces caloric intake but also aligns with Dietary Guidelines for increasing fruit consumption.

### Limitations
- **Data Scope**: The datasets exclude random-weight items and non-UPC-coded products, potentially underrepresenting certain fresh produce prices.
- **Temporal Gap**: The snack substitution analysis relies on 2010 Homescan data, which may not fully reflect 2020–2022 consumption patterns.
- **Regional Variations**: National averages obscure local price differences, which could affect substitution feasibility in specific markets.
- **Caloric Assumptions**: Caloric savings are based on 2012 estimates and may vary with modern snack formulations.

## Recommendations
1. **Promote Low-Cost Options**: Encourage consumption of affordable fruits (e.g., watermelon, bananas) and vegetables (e.g., potatoes, dried beans) through public health campaigns.
2. **Update Substitution Models**: Conduct new studies using recent consumption data to refine snack substitution recommendations.
3. **Incorporate Regional Data**: Future analyses should include regional price data to enhance applicability for diverse populations.
4. **Educational Outreach**: Leverage findings to educate families on cost-effective, healthy snack alternatives, emphasizing caloric and budgetary benefits.

## Conclusion

The analysis of fruit and vegetable prices from 2020 to 2022 reveals moderate price increases, with fresh produce seeing the highest inflation. Despite these rises, substituting energy-dense snacks with fruits and vegetables remains a viable strategy for improving dietary quality without straining household budgets. The consistent caloric savings and potential cost benefits underscore the value of promoting such substitutions, particularly for children. Policymakers and educators should focus on low-cost, nutrient-dense options to maximize public health impact.
